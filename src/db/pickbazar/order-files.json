Horror intends to produce an creepy and shocking atmosphere for the anthology. Horror is frequently divided into the cerebral horror and supernatural horrorsub-genres.

It's frequently told through the standpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted internal comprehensions and fastening on the complex and frequently tortured connections between compulsive and pathological characters Cerebral suspensers frequently incorporate rudiments of riddle, drama, action, and paranoia.
